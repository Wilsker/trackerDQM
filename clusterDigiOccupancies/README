Script runs on local mac machine. Run script using:

$> /usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7.14/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin/python2.7 clusterDigiOccupancies.py

Need python 2.7 as root was compiled using python 2.7 (hence pyroot only works with this version).

Check which python ROOT was compiled with:

$> root-config --config


WARNING: Default Python that is run when running the command "python" (or python you run package that uses pyRoot) must be the same as the one root was installed with otherwise
         pyRoot will not work.
